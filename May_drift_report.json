“Colonel Has Another Outstanding
Solution”
Global Threat Assessments
India–Pakistan Flashpoint
India and Pakistan remain on a hair-trigger in 2025. While outright war has been avoided
since the 2019 Balakot crisis, Kashmir’s status and cross-border militancy keep tensions
high. Both sides observe an uneasy ceasefire along the Line of Control established in Feb
2021, which sharply reduced direct clashes . However, Pakistan’s internal turmoil
–
economic crisis and resurgent terrorism
–
and India’s robust nationalism and military
modernization create an unpredictable mix. Each nation’s nuclear arsenal is expanding
and being modernized despite financial strains , meaning any miscalculation could
escalate catastrophically.
• Terrain: The mountainous Kashmir region and Punjab plains shape
military options. Rugged terrain in Kashmir favors guerrilla infiltration and small-
unit ops, complicating counterinsurgency. Seasonal weather (e.g. summer
mountain passes opening) influences when cross-border incursions or high-
altitude standoﬀs spike. Key chokepoints like mountain passes and the Sir Creek
marshes in the south constrain maneuver.
• Populace: Kashmir’s populace remains divided in loyalties. India’s
heavy security presence and revocation of Kashmir’s autonomy in 2019 fuel local
resentment that militant groups exploit. Pakistani public opinion is sharply anti-
India, pressuring its leadership to “stand firm” on Kashmir. Both governments use
nationalist rhetoric to rally domestic support, but poverty and youth bulges make
populations susceptible to radicalization if diplomacy fails.
• Information: A ferocious narrative war accompanies the military
standoﬀ. India frames itself as a victim of cross-border terrorism and portrays
strikes on militant camps as preemptive security . Pakistan internationalizes the
Kashmir dispute at forums like the UN, seeking sympathy while denying support
for jihadists . Disinformation is rife
–
from doctored videos after border incidents
to rumors of troop movements
–
heightening the risk of overreaction. Each side
censors unfavorable news; social media flashpoints (like viral images of alleged
atrocities) can spark protests and mob violence in minutes.
• Infrastructure: Critical infrastructure is both target and vulnerability.
Pakistan fears India could weaponize water by altering Indus River flows, given
dams upstream. India worries about Pakistan-based militants attacking railways,
power grids or symbols like Parliament (as in 2001). Both have hardened some
sites, butp dense civilian infrastructure (cities, nuclear plants) is at risk if conflict
erupts. Major highways and the Karachi–Lahore–Delhi rail line would become vital
supply routes or targets in war. Any mass refugee flows or urban unrest would
strain government control of infrastructure and essential services.
South China Sea Standoﬀ
Beijing’s aggressive push in the South China Sea (SCS) has turned this maritime region
into a latent flashpoint. China has militarized artificial islands across the Spratlys and
Paracels, extending its reach hundreds of miles south of its coast. In the past year,
regional states like the Philippines and Vietnam have bolstered their maritime patrols and
alliances in response to near-collision incidents and harassment by Chinese ships . The
Philippines, for instance, shifted focus from internal security to external defense as China
repeatedly interfered with its resupply of the grounded BRP Sierra Madre at Second
Thomas Shoal (including using water cannons on Philippine vessels) . Southeast Asian
nations prefer diplomacy but are “friends to all” as great-power rivalry fractures regional
unity . The U.S. has increased freedom-of-navigation patrols and defense ties with allies,
trying to deter Chinese expansion without provocation.
• Terrain (Maritime): The “terrain” is an expanse of ocean dotted with
reefs, shoals, and tiny islets. Shallow waters and reefs define navigational hazards
and the value of each feature (for fishing or oil/gas prospects). Control of features
like Scarborough Shoal and Mischief Reef extends a nation’s surveillance and
missile range over strategic sea lanes. The lack of clear maritime boundaries
creates overlapping exclusive economic zones (EEZs), making every fishing boat
or oil rig a potential trigger. Typhoon season and monsoons also seasonally
impede naval operations and can damage outposts.
• Populace: The human element includes coastal fishing communities
and nationalistic publics. Chinese fishermen (including a state-backed maritime
militia) flood disputed waters, acting as proxies to assert Beijing’s claims . Filipino
and Vietnamese fishers find their livelihoods squeezed and look to their
governments for protection, raising domestic pressure to stand up to China.
National pride is tied to these territories
–
for China, a matter of historical “rights,”
for others, a matter of sovereignty
–
so governments face popular backlash if
perceived as weak.
• Information: Beijing wages an intense information campaign,
invoking historical maps and the “nine-dash line” to legitimize its claims, despite a
2016 international tribunal invalidating them. China’s state media amplifies
narratives that U.S. “meddling” is the cause of tension, aiming to cast Washington
as aggressor. Meanwhile, the Philippines and Vietnam publicize incidents (photos
of close encounters, laser harassment, etc.) to rally world opinion against Chinese
coercion . Cyber domains are also in play: hackers linked to China have targeted
Southeast Asian ministries to glean negotiation positions. Overall, truth is
contested
–
every collision at sea comes with dueling propaganda videos.
• Infrastructure: China’s artificial island bases
–
with runways, radars,
and missile batteries
–
are now semi-permanent infrastructure projecting power
far from its mainland. Regional states lack equivalent structures, though some
(Vietnam, Malaysia) maintain modest outposts on reefs. Undersea
communications cables and energy infrastructure (oﬀshore oil platforms) are
potential collateral damage if conflict erupts. The busy shipping lanes (carrying
one-third of global trade) are critical economic infrastructure; any conflict or
blockade would disrupt global supply chains and energy flows. Ports around the
SCS (Singapore, Manila, etc.) have contingency plans as even a minor naval
skirmish could halt commerce and require rerouting of vessels.
Russia–Ukraine War
The Russia-Ukraine war remains a grinding, high-intensity conflict with global
ramifications. As of May 2025, Russia occupies chunks of eastern and southern Ukraine
but faces fierce Ukrainian resistance bolstered by Western arms. Moscow’s winter 2024
oﬀensive yielded only marginal gains at devastating cost, and Kyiv’s counteroﬀensives,
while incremental, have slowly reclaimed some territory. The war has become an
attritional slog reminiscent of mid-20th century: trench warfare on the steppe, mass
artillery duels, and drone strikes deep behind lines. Putin appears determined to outlast
Western support for Ukraine, betting that war-weariness or political shifts will break the
coalition against him . Meanwhile, NATO displays unprecedented unity
–
expanding to 32
members (Finland in 2023, Sweden in 2024)
–
and continues supplying Ukraine, though
ammunition stockpiles in the West are under strain. Russia’s conventional military is
weakened and its global prestige badly tarnished, yet it shows no sign of abandoning its
aims. The risk of escalation remains
–
recent nuclear rhetoric has been tempered, but
Russia’s doctrine keeps tactical nukes as an option if Putin feels regime survival is at
stake .
• Terrain: Ukraine’s geography has shaped the war. The open plains of
the Donbas favor mechanized maneuver but also leave armor exposed to drones
and anti-tank missiles. Urban areas like Bakhmut and Mariupol turned into
destructive sieges of attrition. The Dnipro River now forms a de facto front line in
the south, acting as a defensive barrier. Rasputitsa (seasonal mud) twice a year
bogs down oﬀensives. As summer approaches, firmer ground enables armor
movement
–
timing oﬀensives around weather is crucial (e.g. Ukraine’s 2024
summer push). Terrain also matters in occupied areas: guerrilla partisans operate
in forests and city streets, ambushing Russian logistics.
• Populace: The Ukrainian populace is mobilized to an extraordinary
degree
–
a “whole-of-nation” resistance. Despite millions displaced internally and
abroad, national identity and will to fight have only hardened. Russia’s brutality
(e.g. attacks on civilians, infrastructure) has galvanized Ukrainians and quashed
any significant pro-Russian sentiment. In Russia, however, the populace is kept
compliant by propaganda and repression; there is fatigue but also fatalism as
casualties mount (Western estimates exceed 200,000 Russian casualties). NATO
populations largely support aiding Ukraine, seeing it as a frontline of democracy
vs. aggression, but that support could erode if economic costs rise or if populist
politics intervene. Moscow also tries to sway global “populace” opinion
–
in
Africa, Asia
–
to frame Western sanctions (blamed for food crises) as the real
villain, with mixed success.
• Information: Information warfare has been central. Russia blankets
its domestic media with false narratives (e.g. accusing the U.S. of bioweapon labs
, labeling Ukraine’s government as “Nazis”) to justify the war. Globally, Moscow
pushes disinformation through troll farms and state outlets to weaken support for
Kyiv and portray NATO as the aggressor. Ukraine, for its part, has won the
narrative in the West through eﬀective strategic communications
–
President
Zelenskyy’s daily messages and vivid storytelling of Ukrainian valor. Cyber
operations complement kinetic fights: Russian hackers have hit Ukrainian grids
and government networks, while Ukraine and hacktivist allies retaliate against
Russian systems. The “battle of narratives” extends to international forums too,
where competing diplomatic messaging seeks to either isolate Moscow or erode
sanctions. Countering Russian and Chinese falsehoods is an ongoing challenge
–
U.S. oﬃcials stress that dangerous false narratives must be countered “before
they take root.”
• Infrastructure: Critical infrastructure in Ukraine has been
deliberately targeted by Russia as a strategy to break the population’s will. Missile
and drone strikes have pummeled Ukraine’s power grid and utilities since late
2022, causing nationwide blackouts . Ukraine has worked miracles to repair
infrastructure quickly, and Western aid has provided spare transformers and air
defenses to protect critical sites. Transportation infrastructure is key for both
sides: Ukraine’s railroads, aided by NATO intelligence, move troops and aid
eﬃciently, whereas Russian supply lines rely on vulnerable bridges (e.g. the Kerch
bridge to Crimea was struck) and rail from Russia. Globally, the war’s impact on
energy and food infrastructure has been felt
–
from sabotage of gas pipelines in
the Baltic to the disruption of grain exports that threatened Middle Eastern and
African food security. The Black Sea grain deal’s collapse saw renewed risk to
shipping. NATO has bolstered protection of its own critical infrastructure (like
undersea cables and pipelines) as Russia exhibits capability and intent to strike at
those in a wider conflict .
Iran’s Regional Posture
Iran is pursuing regional influence aggressively, even as it faces internal and external
pressures. In the wake of the October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel and the ensuing
Israel–Gaza war, Tehran moved to capitalize on the chaos . It amplified support for proxy
militias in Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and Lebanon
–
resulting in sporadic drone and rocket
attacks on U.S. bases in Syria/Iraq and shipping in the Red Sea . Iran’s leadership sees
an opportunity to weaken U.S. influence and rally regional Shi’a allies while Israel is
preoccupied. At the same time, Iran continues to inch toward the nuclear threshold: it
enriches uranium up to 60% and stockpiles advanced centrifuges, bringing breakout
time to mere weeks if a political decision to build a bomb is made . Regionally, the
Abraham Accords momentum has stalled due to the Israel-Hamas war, easing pressure
on Iran. Yet Iran’s economy is battered by sanctions; this, plus memories of late 2022’s
mass protests, keeps the regime wary of domestic unrest. To oﬀset isolation, Tehran has
drawn closer to Moscow and Beijing
–
conducting joint naval drills and arms cooperation
with both . Notably, Iran supplies Russia with armed drones for Ukraine, receiving cash
and captured Western weapons in return, a quid pro quo that boosts its capabilities. Gulf
Arab states remain wary: Saudi-Iran ties slightly warmed in 2023 (with China-brokered
talks), but trust is low and proxy conflicts (like Yemen) smolder on low heat.
• Terrain: Iran operates across diverse terrains in its proxy footprint. In
Lebanon and Syria, mountainous terrain and urban environments shelter Iran-
backed Hezbollah and militias, posing asymmetric threats to Israel and U.S.
forces. In Iraq, the Tigris-Euphrates heartland gives Iran land access to supply
militias and political allies. The narrow Strait of Hormuz
–
a chokepoint Iran
threatens to close in crises
–
is a focal “terrain” feature; Iran’s naval IRGC units
use the maze of Persian Gulf islands to harass shipping. Rugged geography also
shields Iran’s clandestine nuclear and missile sites, many built underground or in
hard-to-reach areas to thwart strikes. Iran’s own internal terrain (vast deserts,
mountains like Zagros) favors defenders; any conventional invasion would be
arduous, a fact that underpins Iran’s strategic confidence.
• Populace: The Iranian populace is a double-edged sword for the
regime. On one hand, a significant segment is ideologically loyal (Basij militia,
IRGC families, etc.), and nationalism would spur them to rally around the flag
against external threats. On the other hand, urban middle-class and young
Iranians are disillusioned
–
evident from recurring protests (the latest in 2022 after
Mahsa Amini’s death). The regime’s legitimacy is brittle; economic pain from
sanctions and mismanagement keeps resentment simmering. Regionally, Iran
seeks to win hearts and minds in the Shi’a Arab population
–
from Baghdad’s
slums to Yemeni Zaydi communities
–
portraying itself as the champion of Muslim
resistance to Israel and Western imperialism. This messaging has had success in
cultivating loyal militias but also backlash (many Iraqis resent excessive Iranian
influence). In Gulf states, Iran’s covert networks among Shi’a minorities remain a
security concern for those governments. Broadly, the Arab Street sees Iran with
mixed views: admired by some for defying the West, reviled by others for stoking
sectarian conflict.
• Information: Iran’s information warfare is sophisticated and multi-
layered. Its state media (Press TV, Al-Alam) and social media influence networks
push narratives framing the U.S. as the root of regional instability and depicting
Iran’s allies (whether Hamas or the Houthis) as legitimate resistance movements.
During the Gaza conflict, Tehran’s propagandists flooded Arabic media with
graphic images of Palestinian suﬀering, aiming to stir anger at Israel and its
supporters . Iran also adeptly uses plausible deniability
–
denying direct role in
proxy attacks while seeding conspiracy theories (e.g. claiming the U.S. or Israel
secretly backs ISIS, etc.). Internally, the regime tightly controls the flow of
information: it throttled the internet and used state TV to smear protesters as
foreign agents in 2022. Cyber is part of this domain
–
Iran’s hackers both attack
adversaries’ information systems (defacing websites, spreading false messages)
and monitor/censor its domestic internet. The “narrative battlefield” extends to
the global stage where Iran, along with Russia and China, pushes a counter-West
narrative of a multipolar world and often exploits U.S. domestic unrest (for
instance, amplifying racial tensions propaganda) to claim Western hypocrisy.
• Infrastructure: Iran’s conventional military and proxy strategy often
targets infrastructure to exert pressure. In recent years Tehran demonstrated this
by enabling the Houthis to hit Saudi oil facilities (e.g. the 2019 Abqaiq attack that
temporarily halved Saudi oil output)
–
showcasing the vulnerability of critical
energy infrastructure . In 2023–24, proxies in Iraq and Syria periodically hit bases
housing U.S. troops with rockets and drones, attempting to make the stay “too
costly.” Iran’s ballistic missiles and drones give it reach to destroy infrastructure
across the Gulf and Levant
–
oil refineries, desalination plants, power grids
–
as
asymmetric leverage. Conversely, Iran’s own infrastructure is under stress: the
sanctions have limited repairs to oil fields and pipelines; electricity blackouts are
common due to mismanagement; and the nuclear program’s facilities are
potential targets of Israeli sabotage (as seen in Natanz site incidents). The regime
guards key infrastructure (ports, military bases, nuclear sites) with layered air
defenses and hardened designs, but softer targets (like civilian airports or
communications nodes) are exposed. A key facet is the Strait of Hormuz: Iran has
emplaced mines and anti-ship missiles that threaten this global oil artery
–
essentially treating international energy infrastructure security as a hostage to its
own security.
Turkey’s Strategic Moves
Turkey (Türkiye) under President Erdoğan continues to pursue an assertive and
independent course, straddling East and West. A NATO member, Turkey nonetheless
often charts its own path: it has balanced relations with Russia and Ukraine throughout
the war, selling drones to Kyiv while refusing to join sanctions on Moscow . In October
2024, Ankara even expressed interest in BRICS, hinting at a non-aligned power
ambition . Erdoğan’s government finally approved Sweden’s NATO accession in March
2024 after protracted bargaining, boosting Alliance unity, but not before extracting
concessions (like renewed U.S. oﬀers of F-16 fighter upgrades). Regionally, Turkey has
leveraged its geographic position and military strength. It wields influence in the
Caucasus
–
backing Azerbaijan’s reclaiming of Nagorno-Karabakh in 2023
–
and
maintains troops in northern Syria and Iraq to fight Kurdish insurgents. In the Aegean,
tensions with Greece simmer over maritime claims, though direct conflict has been
averted through NATO deconfliction channels. Economically, Turkey is recovering from a
2023 currency crisis; Erdoğan has shifted to more orthodox economics post-election, but
to stabilize the economy he deepened energy and trade ties with Russia (e.g. deferred
gas payments, talks of a “gas hub” in Turkey) . In essence, Turkey is trying to become a
Eurasian power broker
–
mediating in Ukraine (it helped broker the Black Sea grain
export deal in 2022), hosting talks between Israel and Hamas’s political wing, and even
courting Gulf investments to bolster its economy. NATO partners value Turkey’s military
(second-largest army in NATO) and strategic location, but remain wary of its S-400 air
defense purchase from Russia and human rights backsliding. Looking ahead, Turkey’s
moves
–
whether aligning with western sanctions or not, whether launching a new
incursion against Syrian Kurdish forces, or brokering diplomatic breakthroughs
–
will
significantly impact regional stability.
• Terrain: Turkey’s geography is destiny
–
controlling the Bosphorus
and Dardanelles (the Black Sea gateways) gives it leverage over Russia’s naval
movements in wartime. Its terrain spans European Thrace to the Armenian
highlands; internally, Turkey’s east is mountainous, facilitating its ongoing
counterinsurgency against the PKK (Kurdish separatists) who use rugged border
areas as sanctuaries. Turkey’s strategic depth and interior lines allow it to shift
forces between theatres (Syria, Aegean, Caucasus) relatively quickly. Earthquake-
prone terrain (as tragically seen in Feb 2023) also poses humanitarian and
readiness challenges. Control of northern Cyprus and a military presence in Qatar,
Somalia, and elsewhere extend its reach. In short, Turkey bestrides multiple
regions
–
Middle East, Europe, Central Asia
–
and exploits the “terrain” of
diplomacy by acting as a gatekeeper (e.g., Montreux Convention control of straits,
or oﬀering transit routes for alternative gas pipelines).
• Populace: Erdoğan’s domestic support rests on nationalist and
conservative pillars. After two decades in power, he cultivates a narrative of
Turkey as a rising great power, which resonates with a populace proud of imperial
Ottoman heritage. However, Turks are also weary of economic troubles
–
high
inflation hit households hard
–
and there is domestic fatigue with hosting 3.6
million Syrian refugees. Anti-refugee sentiment and nationalist fervor are on the
rise, leading to pressure on the government to repatriate Syrians and take a hard
line on Kurdish issues. The large youthful population is split
–
some embrace
Erdoğan’s vision, others yearn for EU-style liberalization. Turkish veterans of Syria
and counter-PKK campaigns carry influence and have bolstered nationalist
politics. Abroad, the Turkish diaspora in Europe (especially Germany) and the
Turkic populations of Central Asia form part of Ankara’s soft-power calculus, as it
promotes itself as leader of a Turkic-Islamic world. Managing popular
expectations (e.g., regarding reconverting Hagia Sophia to a mosque, confronting
Israel over Palestinians, or asserting rights in the Aegean) is crucial for Erdoğan to
maintain legitimacy.
• Information: Ankara is adept at narrative crafting. Domestically, it
has muzzled much of the free press and uses state media (TRT) and friendly
outlets to shape public opinion. The government’s narrative frames Turkey as
“mistreated by the West” but rising nonetheless
–
for example, spinning disputes
(like the U.S. F-35 eviction after the S-400 deal) as Turkey standing firm on its
sovereignty while others are unfair . In foreign aﬀairs, Turkey positions itself as a
voice of the Muslim world
–
Erdoğan’s fiery speeches about Jerusalem or
Rohingya garner support on Arab social media. Simultaneously, Turkish diplomacy
uses quieter channels to reassure NATO allies when crises arise (as seen in de-
escalating incidents with Greece). Disinformation also plays a role: Turkey’s 2023
opposition alleged Russian meddling via deepfakes in the election , showing how
external info ops can intersect with Turkey’s politics. The government has passed
laws against “fake news” online
–
ostensibly to curb foreign influence, though
critics say it stifles dissent. Overall, Turkey runs a multi-vector information
strategy: Westward, it emphasizes commitment to NATO when convenient;
Eastward, it highlights independence from Western diktats. This careful image
management is aimed at maximizing Turkey’s negotiating position on all fronts.
• Infrastructure: Turkey’s infrastructure is both a strength and a
vulnerability in its strategic moves. It boasts NATO’s southern hub at Incirlik Air
Base (hosting U.S. forces and tactical nuclear bombs), major ports on the
Mediterranean and Black Sea, and a sprawling defense industry base. However,
its purchase of the Russian S-400 air defense system
–
not integrated into NATO
networks
–
created an interoperability gap and led the U.S. to cut Turkey from the
F-35 fighter program , illustrating how infrastructure choices (radar systems,
weapons platforms) can have geopolitical fallout. Turkey’s energy infrastructure is
pivotal: pipelines like TANAP (bringing Azerbaijani gas) and TurkStream (Russian
gas) traverse its territory, making it an energy corridor for Europe. Erdoğan has
ambitions to turn Turkey into a gas trading hub, leveraging infrastructure to boost
geopolitical weight . On the flip side, Turkey’s economy depends on tourism and
logistics
–
instability or conflict could deter investment and travel, and incidents
like drone attacks on shipping (if conflict with Greece or involvement in Ukraine
escalated) would hit its infrastructure hard. Additionally, the 2023 earthquake
revealed infrastructure weaknesses (e.g., building code issues) that not only have
humanitarian implications but, if unaddressed, could hamper disaster response or
military mobility in a crisis.
NATO Cohesion and Alliance Dynamics
NATO enters mid-2025 with a strong display of unity but also facing strategic tests. The
alliance weathered the initial shock of Russia’s Ukraine invasion with remarkable
cohesion
–
NATO’s 2024 Washington Summit underscored “unwavering solidarity” with
Ukraine and an “irreversible path” for Kyiv toward future membership . Allies have
collectively provided tens of billions in aid to Ukraine, and nearly all members have
boosted defense spending and forward deployments on the alliance’s eastern flank.
Significantly, NATO enlarged for the first time in a decade: Finland joined in April 2023,
and Sweden followed in March 2024, bringing the alliance to 32 nations and securing the
strategically vital Nordic-Baltic region . This expansion, once stalled by Turkish and
Hungarian objections, ultimately went through
–
a testament to NATO’s ability to resolve
internal disagreements for the greater goal of deterrence. The war has reinvigorated
NATO’s core mission of collective defense; multinational battlegroups are entrenched in
Poland and the Baltics, and new plans are drawn to defend every inch of NATO territory.
However, maintaining cohesion isn’t without challenges. Politically, divergent views exist
on issues like how to handle China’s rise or Middle East instability. Some member
governments (especially in Eastern Europe) urge even tougher stands against Russia,
while a few others (occasionally Hungary or Turkey) have been outliers, calling for
quicker peace or engaging Moscow economically . The U.S. remains NATO’s linchpin, but
European allies are mindful of U.S. elections and the need to shoulder more burden
themselves
–
strategic autonomy debates continue in the EU. Meanwhile, NATO has had
to adapt to novel domains (cyber, space) and tasks (like counter-hybrid warfare), which
requires intense cooperation and trust. So far, Russian attempts to splinter NATO
–
through energy coercion or propaganda
–
largely failed; Europe found alternative gas
sources in 2022–24 and public support for NATO actually climbed in frontline states.
NATO is also strengthening partnerships in the Indo-Pacific (with Japan, Australia, etc.
attending NATO summits) as it recognizes the global nature of security.
• Political Cohesion: NATO’s greatest strength is the political will of 32
democracies to stand together. This cohesion has been tested by election
outcomes (e.g. some Western European populist parties question arms spending)
and by members’ bilateral quirks (Turkey’s initial veto on Sweden’s entry,
Hungary’s rhetoric friendly to Moscow). Through consensus decision-making,
NATO manages these issues behind closed doors
–
often via compromise or side
deals (as seen in Turkey receiving assurances on F-16 sales and counterterrorism
cooperation). The alliance also showed flexibility by creating the NATO-Ukraine
Council in 2023, giving Kyiv a seat at the table without full membership, placating
those who seek to support Ukraine’s defense while stopping short of formal
Article 5 commitments. NATO’s political unity has held remarkably firm
–
a notable
irony for Putin, who aimed to weaken NATO but instead achieved its expansion
and renewed purpose.
• Populace (Public Support): Public opinion across member states
underpins NATO cohesion. In Eastern NATO countries (Poland, Baltics, Romania),
Russia’s aggression has cemented public resolve in favor of NATO’s protective
umbrella
–
these societies have among the highest pro-NATO sentiments and
willingness to host troops. In Western Europe, populations generally support
Ukraine but worry about war escalation; NATO leaders have been careful to
communicate defensive intentions and avoid panic. U.S. public support for NATO
remains solid, though partisan divides exist
–
this makes continued alliance unity
partially contingent on U.S. domestic politics (e.g. a more isolationist turn could
strain NATO). NATO actively counters disinformation aimed at its populations:
Russia’s propaganda trying to blame NATO for the war or exaggerate nuclear
threats is met with factual media campaigns. Importantly, citizens in NATO
countries have felt the war’s secondary eﬀects (energy prices, inflation), but so far
they associate those hardships with Russian aggression, not with NATO’s stance.
Maintaining popular support is critical; alliance cohesion could fray if war fatigue
or economic pain outstrip the perceived threat. Hence NATO is investing in
narrative resilience
–
highlighting defense of shared democratic values and
successes like Finland/Sweden accession to keep its people supportive.
• Information and Cyber: In the information domain, NATO
coordinates closely to present a united narrative and counter malign influence.
The Alliance’s StratCom (Strategic Communications) units work overtime busting
myths (for instance, debunking false Russian claims of NATO provocations).
Russian and Chinese info ops target NATO’s cohesion
–
from hacking and leaking
sensitive communications to amplifying divisive social issues in member states.
NATO’s collective response includes intelligence sharing on disinformation
campaigns and, through the Five Eyes and EU partners, imposing costs on
propagandists (sanctioning Russian state media, etc.). Cyber defense cooperation
has intensified: a cyberattack on one ally is now clearly acknowledged as
potentially invoking Article 5. Joint cyber ranges and rapid-response teams (e.g. to
help Montenegro or Baltic states under cyber assault) have bolstered defenses.
NATO’s new Cyber Operations Centre underscores treating information/cyber as
key battlefields. By controlling the narrative (truthfully) and protecting networks,
NATO shields the cohesion that enemies seek to undermine.
• Infrastructure (Military & Economic): NATO has strengthened its
military infrastructure and logistics for the new era of great-power deterrence.
This includes pre-positioning heavy equipment in Eastern Europe, expanding fuel
and ammunition depots, and upgrading transportation networks for rapid
reinforcement. The collapse of the INF Treaty and Russia’s deployment of missile
systems has NATO investing in new air/missile defenses across Europe.
Additionally, NATO countries have worked to interconnect their energy
infrastructure to prevent any single member from being blackmailed (e.g. new
interconnectors for gas and electricity in the Baltic region to isolate Russia’s
leverage). Civil infrastructure security
–
protecting undersea internet cables,
transatlantic fiber lines, and space assets
–
is now on NATO’s radar as critical to
collective defense. Regular exercises practice moving U.S. divisions across the
Atlantic and Europe, testing port and rail capacities. Economically, NATO as an
alliance doesn’t direct trade, but informally members coordinate on sanctions and
supply chain security (for instance, ensuring rare earth supply if China were to
restrict exports). All these measures buttress NATO’s ability to operate jointly.
Despite occasional friction (for example, over where to spend procurement funds
or diﬀering views on European defense initiatives), NATO’s infrastructure
investments clearly signal long-term resolve to any adversary contemplating a
test of the alliance’s unity.
Five Eyes Intelligence Alliance
The Five Eyes (FVEY)
–
the intelligence partnership of the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia,
and New Zealand
–
remains the world’s most comprehensive espionage-sharing
arrangement. As of 2025, the alliance is stronger than ever, having expanded its scope
from traditional signals intelligence to tackling emerging threats like cyber espionage
and technology theft. Five Eyes has been pivotal in the Russia–Ukraine war (feeding high-
grade intel to Ukraine and coordinating exposures of Russian war crimes and plans) and
in monitoring China’s activities (e.g. sharing surveillance of Chinese naval movements
and potential military AI developments). The trust built over 80 years allows near-
seamless exchange of secrets at the highest classification, giving each member a
multiplier in intelligence capacity that far exceeds going it alone. Recently, the Five Eyes
partners have launched Secure Innovation initiatives to protect their cutting-edge tech
industries from espionage . This includes issuing joint guidance to companies about the
threats of foreign infiltration and economic espionage
–
a rare public-facing project for
the traditionally secretive network, underscoring how salient the tech security issue has
become.
The Five Eyes alliance is also adapting its intelligence methods to new domains. There is
a push for a shared top-secret cloud environment accessible by all five nations to speed
data analysis and dissemination. Joint teams regularly collaborate on counter-terrorism,
signals interception, and cryptanalysis eﬀorts. In counterintelligence, Five Eyes agencies
exchange leads on hostile foreign influence within their borders
–
for example,
uncovering a Chinese spy ring in Canada or Russia’s hacking of Australia’s parliament,
with intelligence flowing swiftly across the alliance. A challenge the alliance faces is
ensuring internal discipline and trust
–
leaks like those by Snowden in 2013 tested
relations, as have occasional divergent policies (New Zealand’s softer stance on China or
diﬀering legal limits on surveillance). Still, mechanisms like the Five Eyes Oversight
Council exist to smooth over legal/political diﬀerences and keep the collaboration robust
.
Importantly, Five Eyes is expanding cooperation beyond government spy agencies. In
October 2024, for instance, the domestic security services of all five (like FBI, MI5, CSIS,
ASIO, NZSIS) held a historic summit with industry and academia to raise awareness of
state threats to tech sectors . This whole-of-society approach is born from recognizing
that China and others target not just defense secrets but commercial and research data
at universities and startups. Five Eyes intelligence has publicly fingered China for large-
scale hacking and IP theft, and similarly called out North Korea and Iran for cybercrimes.
The alliance’s status is such that it may unoﬃcially grow
–
Japan, France, and others
have sought closer intel-sharing; while they won’t join Five Eyes formally, ad-hoc “Five
Eyes+” arrangements now exist for specific issues (e.g. sharing North Korea missile
launch warnings).
In summary, the Five Eyes alliance is a cornerstone of the Western security architecture,
underpinning everything from military operations to cybersecurity. Its status in 2025 is
one of enhanced cooperation, particularly in countering great-power espionage. By
pooling their intelligence, the five nations maintain an edge in the shadow wars
–
detecting threats earlier and responding in unison. For example, Five Eyes cooperation
recently helped disrupt a cyber plot and trace stolen cryptocurrency, denying Pyongyang
funds for its weapons programs. The alliance is also a force multiplier in counter-
narrative eﬀorts: intelligence findings (satellite images, intercepted communications) can
be declassified and jointly released to debunk adversary propaganda, as was done to
preempt false Russian justifications for the war. All Five Eyes members understand that
in the face of China’s rise and Russia’s provocations, staying aligned is paramount. The
result is an intelligence community that acts as one, giving the broader coalition (NATO,
AUKUS, etc.) a clear informational advantage.
Counterintelligence and Espionage Threats
Foreign espionage against the United States and its allies is at an apex not seen since
the Cold War. China is the most active adversary in this arena
–
from classic spying to
massive cyber theft. FBI and CIA oﬃcials warn that China’s intelligence apparatus works
at a scale that “blew past” anything from Russia in the past; as of 2024 the FBI was
opening a new China-related counterintelligence case almost every 12 hours. Chinese
spies target U.S. defense contractors, government agencies, and increasingly state and
local entities (witness the 2023 case of a Naval engineer arrested for passing secrets, or
the uncovering of a presumed Chinese agent working in a U.K. parliamentary oﬃce).
Economic espionage is a particular focus: Beijing has a voracious appetite for
technology
–
semiconductors, AI, biotech
–
and uses a mix of cyber intrusions, talent
recruitment programs, and front companies to steal intellectual property. One striking
example was the 2024 indictment of individuals stealing aerospace designs, showing
how China leverages academic exchanges for spying. In response, Western agencies
(often coordinating via Five Eyes) have ramped up arrests and exposure of spy networks,
and tightened screening of visa applicants in sensitive fields.
Russia, though hobbled by sanctions and expulsion of diplomats, remains a potent
espionage threat. Its SVR and GRU have adapted by using non-oﬃcial cover agents
(illegals) and cyber means to collect intelligence where its declared spies can no longer
travel freely. In 2023, several European nations rolled up Russian illegal spy rings
–
including a couple in Slovenia posing as antique dealers. Moscow also continues
aggressive cyber espionage: hacking U.S. grid networks and government servers (e.g.
the SolarWinds hack revelations are still being dealt with) and phishing campaigns
targeting NATO oﬃcials. Counterintelligence has had successes: dozens of Russian
spies have been expelled or prosecuted since 2022, and Western services carefully
monitor known Russian intelligence travel. But Russia compensates by recruiting third-
country nationals or exploiting sympathetic far-right and far-left activists in target
countries to indirectly gather intel or spread influence.
Iran and North Korea present more specialized but serious threats. Tehran’s intelligence
focuses on dissidents abroad (plotting against Iranian opposition figures in the U.S. and
Europe, some of which have been thwarted) and procurement for its nuclear program
–
using illicit networks to acquire technology despite export controls. North Korea employs
cyber operatives for espionage and financial gain; Pyongyang’s hackers have stolen not
only money but also defense secrets (such as a reported breach of a South Korean arms
database). Additionally, North Korea runs revenue-driven schemes like dispatching
operatives abroad under fake identities (e.g. arms deal negotiators, or IT workers in
foreign companies) to earn hard currency and glean intel.
A disturbing trend in counterintelligence is the insider threat phenomenon. Beyond
ideological spies, there have been cases of insiders leaking classified info on social
media (e.g. a National Guard airman leaked documents on Discord in 2023). These
incidents highlight challenges in vetting and monitoring personnel in the digital age. U.S.
agencies are responding with stricter background checks, continuous monitoring
programs, and reminding personnel of their oaths.
Finally, espionage is no longer confined to stealing state secrets; it merges with influence
operations. For instance, foreign intelligence services use social media “persona”
accounts to connect with and recruit targets (like Chinese agents posing on LinkedIn to
lure engineers). They also seed disinformation to shape public discourse
–
a form of
active measures short of direct spying. Counterintelligence now means not just catching
spies but blunting these influence campaigns, through public exposure and building
societal resilience. The bottom line: the spy threat environment is extraordinarily
dynamic, requiring the U.S. to integrate its counterintelligence across FBI, CIA, military
services, and allies. Eﬀorts like the Five Eyes’ joint advisories to industry , and high-
profile DOJ prosecutions, aim to impose costs on adversaries and deter some activities.
But the cat-and-mouse game intensifies as rivals employ new tricks (from AI-generated
deepfake identities to cryptography that hides their communications). Vigilance in
counterespionage is a strategic must to protect U.S. advantages.
Cryptocurrency and Illicit Finance Dynamics
Cryptocurrency has emerged as a double-edged sword in global security
–
on one hand
an innovative financial tool, on the other a facilitator of illicit activities by adversaries,
criminals, and extremists. North Korea stands out as a state leveraging crypto to bypass
sanctions: in 2024, North Korean hackers stole an estimated **$1.3 billion in
cryptocurrency
–
a record haul, nearly double the $660 million they took in 2023 . These
heists (often hacking DeFi platforms or exchanges) are converted to cash through
laundering networks and likely fund Kim Jong-un’s nuclear and ICBM programs . This
represents a frightening new revenue stream for a rogue state under heavy sanctions.
The FBI has labeled one series of North Korean hacking operations “TraderTraitor,”
highlighting how the regime’s cyber units relentlessly target crypto markets . The U.S.
has responded by sanctioning mixers (like Tornado Cash) that the DPRK uses to launder
stolen coins, and by working with crypto firms to trace and freeze assets where
possible . Still, the sheer scale of decentralized finance makes complete prevention
diﬃcult.
Russia-aligned actors also exploit cryptocurrency. Ransomware gangs (many harbored
in Russia) routinely extort payments in Bitcoin or Monero from Western companies and
infrastructure operators. Notorious incidents like the 2021 Colonial Pipeline ransomware
attack showed how a handful of hackers can disrupt critical fuel supply
–
they received
crypto payment, some of which U.S. law enforcement later clawed back. These
ransomware funds are suspected to circulate partly back into Russia’s economy or even
its intelligence coﬀers (some groups are entwined with Russian security services).
Additionally, Russia and Iran have both explored using crypto for sanctions evasion
–
for
example, establishing state-run mining operations to earn Bitcoin, or conducting trade
with each other via digital currencies outside the SWIFT system. Iran was reported to
have used crypto to pay for imports like sanctioned supplies. Such activities are still
relatively limited in scale but could grow if crypto adoption widens and regulation
remains patchy.
On the terrorism and crime front, cryptocurrencies present a mixed picture. Large
jihadist organizations still primarily rely on traditional money transfer methods (or cash
smuggling), but there have been cases of ISIS and al-Qaeda aﬃliates soliciting donations
in Bitcoin on encrypted messaging channels. Law enforcement has busted several such
fundraising cells, seizing their wallets. Transnational criminal organizations
–
from Latin
American cartels to European darknet markets
–
certainly appreciate the anonymity of
crypto. They use it for money laundering, as seen in cartel-linked gangs using Bitcoin
ATMs and exchanges to mask drug money flows. However, the transparency of
blockchain has also enabled new investigative tools: authorities track transaction
ledgers to map criminal networks, and international cooperation (Interpol, etc.) has
improved to tackle crypto-crime.
A major dynamic in 2025 is regulation vs. innovation. Western governments are
tightening oversight of crypto exchanges (know-your-customer rules, reporting large
transfers) to close loopholes that criminals and sanctioned regimes exploit. The
European Union’s new regulations and U.S. Treasury’s guidance have somewhat pushed
illicit actors to less regulated jurisdictions or to privacy coins. Meanwhile, legitimate use
of cryptocurrencies and blockchain tech continues to grow
–
central banks research
digital currencies, and fintech firms innovate new products. This creates a cat-and-
mouse interplay: as the legitimate crypto economy expands, adversaries try to piggyback
on it clandestinely, while regulators seek to safeguard innovation and security. One
noteworthy eﬀort is the Five Eyes working group on crypto threats, sharing intelligence
on how groups like North Korea’s Lazarus Group move stolen crypto through myriad
addresses .
The narrative around crypto also matters. In some circles, cryptocurrencies were
idealized as tools of financial freedom; now, their association with ransom, theft, and
sanctions-busting gives them a darker cast. U.S. oﬃcials must navigate public
perception carefully
–
encouraging blockchain innovation for economic benefit, while
candidly exposing its abuse by bad actors. So far, targeted sanctions and high-profile
indictments (e.g., the DOJ charging crypto exchange oﬃcials who facilitated laundering)
have signaled that lawlessness in this domain won’t be tolerated. Yet the decentralized,
borderless nature of cryptocurrency means truly shutting down illicit use is very
challenging
–
it requires global coordination and technological savvy (like developing
advanced blockchain analytics and AI detection of illicit patterns). The U.S. is investing in
those capabilities. In summary, cryptocurrency has become a new battleground in
counter-threat finance: from North Korean hackers funding WMDs with digital loot , to
terrorists and traﬃckers seeking anonymity. The U.S. and allies are racing to adapt legal
and technical tools to ensure this innovation doesn’t become a haven for those who wish
us harm.
U.S. Force Readiness and Posture
Active Duty Military
The United States Active Duty force in 2025 remains the world’s preeminent fighting
force, but it is under strain and transition. After two decades of counterinsurgency and
counterterror operations, the military is refocusing on high-intensity conflict and great
power competition. Readiness levels across the services are a top priority: intensive
training rotations, joint exercises, and investments in maintenance have improved unit
readiness compared to the late 2010s. For example, Army brigade combat teams have
higher rates of personnel and equipment readiness, and the Air Force reports more
squadrons meeting mission-capable targets. However, challenges persist—particularly
the recruiting shortfall that emerged in recent years. In FY2022 and FY2023, the Army
missed recruiting goals by around 15,000 each year (roughly 25%) , citing a smaller
eligible pool and low propensity to serve. The good news: recruiting rebounded in
FY2024, with the services collectively enlisting 25,000 more recruits than the previous
year . The Army met its goal of 55,000 recruits in 2024 after instituting new incentives
and prep courses . Other branches like the Air Force barely hit their marks but plan
increased goals for 2025 . This turnaround suggests the worst of the manpower crisis
may be passing, but the military will need to continue innovating to attract talent (e.g.,
oﬀering cyber and technical career tracks, adjusting fitness standards, etc.).
In terms of posture, Active Duty deployments have shifted rather than reduced. About
100,000 U.S. troops are now in Europe
–
a level not seen since the 1990s
–
to deter Russia
(with new permanent headquarters in Poland and rotational armored units in the Baltics).
In the Indo-Pacific, the Navy and Marines are positioning more assets: rotational USMC
littoral regiments in Okinawa and new access agreements for U.S. forces in Philippine
bases aim to check Chinese aggression. The Navy’s forward-deployed 7th Fleet in Japan
remains a linchpin, though sustaining readiness has been a challenge (ship maintenance
backlogs persist). The Marine Corps has been undergoing Force Design 2030,
restructuring for expeditionary advance base operations with an eye on China
–
smaller
infantry units with anti-ship missiles dispersed across islands. This controversial shift
(less armor, more drones) is largely in eﬀect, though being refined. The Air Force is
moving toward the Agile Combat Employment (ACE) concept, practicing rapid dispersal
of aircraft to austere airstrips in Asia to avoid being caught on large bases by missile
salvos. On the hardware side, Active forces are fielding new systems: e.g., the Army is
introducing hypersonic missiles and new air defense batteries; the Navy’s first Columbia-
class ballistic missile sub will be operational by late 2020s but meanwhile aging Ohio-
class subs strain under extended patrols; the Air Force rolled out the B-21 Raider stealth
bomber in 2024 and continues F-35 procurement albeit at moderated rates.
Morale and training are emphases as well. The all-volunteer force has been stressed by
constant deployments, but the drawdown in the Middle East (only 2,500 troops remain in
Iraq as trainers, and a light footprint in Syria against ISIS) has eased tempo for some
units. This has allowed more high-end training exercises like Project Convergence and
Red Flag that simulate near-peer combat. Special Operations Forces (SOF) are adjusting
too: SEALs, Green Berets, etc., now split eﬀorts between counterterrorism and “Strategic
Competition” missions (like training Pacific partners, or preparing to sabotage enemy
infrastructure if needed). A persistent concern is the health of the force
–
physically
(injuries from intensive training, ensuring medical readiness) and mentally (combating
PTSD and suicide). The Pentagon has initiatives to improve barracks housing, childcare
for families, and spouse employment, recognizing quality of life as integral to readiness.
In summary, Active Duty readiness is medium-high and rising, but not without issues. The
force is modernizing for the challenges of Russia and China while trying to shed the
ineﬃciencies and bad habits of the long counterinsurgency era. Budget wise, FY2025
saw a healthy increase focused on procurement and R&D (AI, cyber, space). The concept
of integrated deterrence means Active forces are more often operating alongside allies
and across domains (cyber commands and Space Force elements working with
conventional units). There is also an eﬀort to bolster resilience of bases at home against
potential missile or cyber attacks, given homeland threats from peer missiles (like a
hypothetical future Chinese ICBM strike or Russian sub-launched Kalibr cruise missiles).
The Active force stands ready, but must be agile and adaptable
–
whether deterring in
Europe, sailing in contested Pacific waters, or responding to a Middle East flare-up
–
potentially all at once. This global simultaneity is the core challenge of U.S. Active Duty
posture in 2025.
Reserve Component
The Reserve Component
–
including both the federal Reserves of each service and the
National Guard
–
is an indispensable element of U.S. military readiness. After decades of
being a “strategic reserve,” the Guard and Reserves have eﬀectively become an
operational reserve, routinely engaged in missions abroad and at home. Manpower &
Readiness: The Reserve Component faces similar recruiting hurdles as the active force,
though it benefits from attracting prior-service personnel. Retention is generally solid as
many citizen-soldiers value continuing service part-time. However, the high ops tempo
from 2001–2021 (repeated Guard/Reserve deployments to Iraq, Afghanistan, Horn of
Africa, etc.) did strain some units. By 2025, there’s been a bit of reset; fewer reservists
are in constant combat rotations. Reserve units are training hard to maintain combat
readiness, but resource constraints (aging equipment, fewer full-time support personnel)
are challenges. The Army National Guard has modernized many Brigade Combat Teams
with updated vehicles and communications, but some shortfalls remain in high-tech
enablers (e.g., electronic warfare gear). The Air National Guard flies a significant portion
of USAF missions, including homeland air defense
–
yet some ANG fighter squadrons still
operate older F-15C/Ds or F-16s awaiting replacement, making equipment
recapitalization critical.
Domestic Role: The National Guard in particular has been extremely active domestically.
In the past few years, Guardsmen have responded to record wildfires in the West,
hurricanes in the Gulf, and civil disturbances. They were deployed in large numbers for
COVID-19 relief in 2020-21 and for security in Washington, D.C., after the January 2021
Capitol riot. Such missions demonstrate the Guard’s dual state-federal role and its
importance as the first military responder at home. It also means ensuring readiness for
domestic emergencies is as high a priority as warfighting skills. Engineering units,
medical detachments, and MPs in the Guard have honed expertise in disaster response.
However, heavy domestic use can wear equipment and limit time for wartime training, a
balance that leaders carefully manage.
Integration with Active Duty: The Total Force policy means Reserve units will integrate
with Active ones if a major conflict erupts. Indeed, on NATO’s eastern flank, U.S. Army
National Guard brigades have been rotating through Europe to bolster deterrence and
relieve active units. The Reserves also provide critical enablers
–
for instance, the Air
Force Reserve and Air Guard handle the majority of aerial refueling and airlift sorties, a
backbone for power projection. In a conflict with China, mobilizing Guard tanker and
transport squadrons would be one of the first steps to sustain operations over the vast
Pacific. The Navy Reserve has filled roles in intelligence and cyber, and even reactivated
a reserve Destroyer Squadron for operations. One lesson from Ukraine is the value of
territorial defense forces; in the U.S., the Guard would perform a similar function for local
defense (like protecting infrastructure or providing cyber defense teams for state
networks).
Challenges: A key issue is ensuring rapid mobilization ability. Posture exercises have
revealed some friction in call-up processes and deployability of certain Reserve units
within 30-60 days. Eﬀorts are underway to streamline mobilization, improve pre-
mobilization training, and pre-position heavy equipment for Guard use (so they don’t
have to haul tanks from the U.S. in a crisis). Another challenge is the civilian employment
of reservists
–
lengthy activations put strain on employers and families. The Uniformed
Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) protects jobs, but
repeated activations can test those relationships. Hence, DOD is judicious in how it
employs the Reserve Component, trying to give predictability via scheduled rotations and
“Guard weekends” while being ready to surge when the nation calls.
Overall, the Reserve and Guard forces are reasonably ready and quite experienced,
though not as uniformly equipped as active forces. Their combat experience from the
War on Terror era, combined with fresh training for near-peer conflict (e.g. large-scale
Combat Training Center rotations for Guard brigades), makes them a credible reserve.
They also serve as a bridge to American society
–
being citizen-soldiers
–
and thus play a
role in sustaining public support for defense. In any protracted conflict or large-scale
emergency, the Reserve Component will be a vital augmentation, bringing additional
manpower, skills (many have relevant civilian skills in tech, engineering, medicine), and
endurance to U.S. military operations.
Veteran Community
The United States has a vast and diverse veteran community (over 17 million strong),
which in many ways is a latent strategic asset
–
a reservoir of trained, disciplined
individuals with leadership experience. The veteran community in 2025 is shaped by the
post-9/11 wars: a younger cohort of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans now in mid-career,
and older cohorts from the Cold War and Gulf War entering retirement. Readiness and
Role: While veterans are no longer in uniform, they significantly influence society and can
be mobilized in various ways. Many veterans continue to serve in civilian capacities
–
as
defense contractors, first responders, educators, or volunteers in organizations like
Team Rubicon (which deploys vets for disaster relief). This means their skills remain in
play. In national emergencies, veterans often self-organize to help (e.g., volunteer
evacuations during crises, or mentoring military families). If a truly existential war arose,
some veterans could even be tapped for Home Guard roles or to train new recruits,
leveraging their experience.
Support and Stability: One measure of this community’s “posture” is how well they’re
supported, to prevent social issues or unrest. The Department of Veterans Aﬀairs (VA)
has in recent years expanded programs for mental health (including a focus on suicide
prevention and PTSD treatment), as well as job training and health care via the PACT Act
for toxic exposure victims. The hope is to avoid past mistakes
–
such as after World War
I, when neglected veterans led the Bonus Army protest in 1932, demanding overdue pay
during the Great Depression . That historical lesson weighs on planners: today, ensuring
veterans receive their benefits and respect is critical not just morally but for social
stability. Indeed, there is an understanding that disillusioned veterans can become
targets for extremist recruitment
–
as seen in a few high-profile cases of veterans
involved in the Jan 6, 2021 Capitol attack. That’s a small minority, but it underscores that
if veterans feel betrayed or desperate (like the Bonus Marchers living in shantytowns), it
could lead to domestic turmoil. Hence the emphasis on strong VA support and
integration of vets into communities.
Veterans’ Influence: The veteran community also wields considerable soft power in
American society. Veterans in politics (from local oﬃce up to Congress) often shape
defense and foreign policy debates
–
typically advocating for robust national security and
care for those who serve. Figures like Senators who are Iraq/Afghan war vets add
credibility to decisions on use of force or diplomacy. Veterans also run or contribute to
non-profits that address national security from a citizen perspective (for example, groups
combating misinformation or aiding Afghan interpreters’ resettlement). Their voice can
serve as a moral compass on issues of war and peace, due to their lived experience.
Public trust in the military remains relatively high, and by extension, veterans carry that
trust when they speak on national issues.
Mobilization Potential: In an extreme scenario, veterans are a manpower pool that could
potentially be mobilized. While the U.S. hasn’t seriously considered a draft since Vietnam,
one imagines that if a peer war erupted, recent veterans (those out less than say 5 years)
might be recalled or volunteer back (as many did after 9/11). Older veterans might serve
in training, logistics, or civil defense roles. Organizations like the American Legion and
VFW could assist in recruitment drives or civil support tasks. The Pentagon doesn’t have
a formal “veteran recall” program beyond the Individual Ready Reserve (which covers
first few years after active service), but plans are being discussed on how to leverage
skilled former servicemembers in cyber or space domains during crises (e.g., calling on
veteran cyber analysts to help defend networks in a national cyber emergency).
In essence, the veteran community’s posture is one of a strategic reserve in society
–
mostly civilian but carrying military ethos and skills. The key is maintaining their well-
being and positive engagement. Success stories abound: veteran unemployment hit
record lows pre-2020 and has stabilized again; many Fortune 500 companies actively hire
vets for leadership positions. Addressing lingering issues
–
suicide rates still above
civilian average, some homeless vets (especially from Vietnam era) needing help
–
is vital
both for moral duty and to remove any seeds of discontent. The memory of the Bonus
Army, where impoverished vets were violently dispersed by the Army , is an irony and
warning: a nation must honor its veterans to avoid eroding the very social fabric the
military fights for. So far, the U.S. in 2025 seems to understand that contract better than
in 1932, as evidenced by broad bipartisan support for veteran benefits. This ensures the
veteran community remains an asset and not a destabilizer.
Domestic Civil Forces (Police & Homeland Security)
The readiness and posture of America’s domestic civil security forces
–
police,
immigration enforcement, border security, and related agencies
–
are a critical
component of national resilience. These forces form the first line of defense against
internal unrest, transnational crime, terrorism, and border infiltrations. In the past few
years, they have been tested by surges in violent crime, civil disorder, and unprecedented
migration flows.
Law Enforcement (Police): Policing in the U.S. has undergone intense scrutiny and some
reform since 2020’s protests against brutality. While those events led to personnel
challenges (a wave of retirements and diﬃculties recruiting in some cities), by 2024 many
departments began stabilizing. Crime rates, which spiked in 2020–2021 (particularly
homicides in major cities), showed signs of leveling oﬀ or decreasing modestly in 2023,
though they remain above pre-pandemic lows. Police forces have been investing in
training
–
de-escalation tactics, community engagement
–
to rebuild trust. Readiness-
wise, most urban police departments are better equipped now with non-lethal tools and
intelligence-led policing methods (like real-time crime centers monitoring CCTV and
ShotSpotter sensors). Morale among oﬃcers has been a concern, but signs of
improvement are there where community support initiatives bear fruit and pay has been
increased to retain talent. Federal grants have helped hire more detectives to tackle
organized retail theft and gun traﬃcking across state lines, treating those as organized
crime. Should large-scale civil unrest recur (for instance, related to a contentious
election or economic hardship), police forces are more cognizant of needing
coordination with National Guard and of the optics of heavy-handedness. In terms of
counterterrorism, local law enforcement remains plugged into the FBI’s Joint Terrorism
Task Forces
–
crucial for detecting homegrown violent extremists (whether jihadist-
inspired or white supremacist). We’ve seen a few lone-wolf plots interdicted thanks to
these partnerships.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) & Border Patrol: These agencies under DHS
have been under immense strain due to high migration at the southern border. Fiscal
year 2024 saw near-record numbers of migrant encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border,
driven by instability in Latin America (Venezuela, Central America) and smuggling
networks exploiting policy changes. The Border Patrol has swelled ranks and deployed
more technology (aerial surveillance drones, ground sensors) to manage the flow. Still,
processing centers were overwhelmed at times, requiring surges of personnel from
across DHS. The posture of border forces is defensive but flexible
–
they’ve had to toggle
between humanitarian roles (caring for asylum seekers) and security roles (interdicting
cartel smugglers). Cooperation with the military remains important: units of the National
Guard continue to assist with surveillance and logistics on the border, and in 2024 active-
duty troops were again temporarily deployed to help manage migrant intake and free up
agents for law enforcement. ICE, focusing on interior enforcement and removal
operations, has shifted some focus toward targeting criminal gangs (like MS-13) and
fentanyl traﬃckers rather than casting a wide net on all undocumented persons. This
targeting is both a resource necessity and politically driven adjustment. The posture of
ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations arm is quite proactive
–
they work globally to
crack down on smuggling rings (for example, undercover ops against document forgers
and human traﬃckers in South America). Morale in these agencies fluctuates with the
political climate; they have been politicized at times, but agents largely keep mission-
focused. A recent point of emphasis is countering the illicit drug crisis: DEA and
Homeland Security forces are collaborating to stem the flow of fentanyl precursors from
China (using financial sanctions and undercover buys) and to catch shipments at the
border (new high-throughput scanners at ports of entry are scanning trucks for hidden
drug loads).
Other Domestic Security Elements: This includes the likes of the FBI (domestic
intelligence and federal crimes), FEMA (disaster response), and even public health
agencies in biosecurity roles. The FBI’s readiness is strong; they have pivoted a share of
counterterror resources to domestic terrorism (racist and anti-government extremists),
following an uptick in those threats since 2020. They also are deeply involved in
counterintelligence at home, as noted, tracking foreign spies and influence
–
essentially
making them a bridge between national security and homeland security. FEMA’s posture
was tested during the pandemic and in climate disasters; lessons learned have led to
better stockpiling of emergency supplies and improved coordination with DoD’s Northern
Command for disaster relief.
Coordination and Preparedness: A notable advancement is the maturation of “Whole-of-
Government” incident response. Multi-agency coordination centers stand ready for
crises: whether a major cyberattack on critical infrastructure, a terrorist incident, or civil
unrest after a controversial court verdict. Federal, state, and local agencies conduct
regular tabletop exercises for such scenarios (the 2024 national level exercise simulated
a dirty bomb attack, integrating police, FBI, Guard units, and emergency managers). On
the U.S. northern border and ports, CBP (Customs and Border Protection) has improved
scanning and vetting to intercept weapons or radiological materials that could be
smuggled in, responding to concerns of adversaries potentially exploiting any weak links.
Community Ties: Domestic forces realize that community relationships are crucial.
Programs like “see something, say something” for counterterrorism and community
policing for crime have been reinvigorated. Trust between law enforcement and
communities of color, while still fraught in places, is a focus area to prevent domestic
instability and enhance cooperation (people are more likely to tip oﬀ police about a
brewing threat if trust exists).
In sum, America’s domestic civil forces are stretched but adapting. They form a
patchwork quilt of capabilities that collectively address threats from violent crime to
espionage within our borders. Their readiness is part muscle (training, equipment) and
part mind (policies, public trust). After facing a cascade of challenges in recent years
–
pandemic, protests, crime swings, migrant surges
–
these agencies have gained hard-
earned experience. Like the military, they’ve had to learn to expect the unexpected
(chaos-ready, one might say) and to be agile. Continued investment in their training,
mental health (for first responders under stress), and inter-agency communication will
determine how well they keep the homeland secure and resilient in the face of whatever
crises the future holds.
Artificial Intelligence: Strategic Asset and Risk
Advances in AI Hardware and Software
Artificial Intelligence has leaped ahead since the early 2020s, becoming a central focus
for national security planners. The hardware underpinning AI
–
specifically advanced
semiconductor chips
–
has itself become a strategic commodity. The U.S. and allies
maintain an edge in cutting-edge AI hardware design (GPUs from companies like NVIDIA,
Google’s TPUs, etc.), but much manufacturing occurs in East Asia. To secure this supply,
the U.S. enacted export controls in 2022-2023 to bar China from obtaining top-tier 5nm-
and-below AI chips, aiming to slow Beijing’s military AI projects. In 2025, this tech
restriction battle continues; China is trying to develop indigenous chip alternatives and
using shell companies to evade controls. Meanwhile, Western industry is innovating
next-generation AI accelerators (e.g., neuromorphic chips that mimic the human brain,
and photonic processors using light for faster computation). On the software side, the
explosion of generative AI is evident. Models like GPT-4 (2023) and successor large
language models (LLMs) have enabled machines to create human-like text, imagery, and
even basic video. Such capabilities have civil applications but also defense ones:
analysts use AI to sift intelligence data, war-gamers employ AI-driven simulations to test
strategies, and logisticians rely on AI optimization for supply chains.
The U.S. military and IC (Intelligence Community) are urgently integrating AI. Programs
like Project Maven (which applies AI to drone surveillance footage analysis) proved their
worth by significantly speeding up target recognition and reducing analyst fatigue. Now,
Maven’s spirit is institutionalized in the DoD’s Chief Digital and AI Oﬃce (CDAO), which
oversees dozens of pilots: predictive maintenance algorithms for aircraft (to anticipate
part failures), AI-enabled cybersecurity that detects intrusions in real-time, and decision-
support tools that can crunch operational data and suggest courses of action. The Army
is testing AI for visual navigation in autonomous vehicles and improving simulation
training by having AI opposition forces. The Navy explores AI for submarine detection
(processing sonar and satellite data with machine learning to spot patterns humans
might miss). The Air Force’s Skyborg program worked on AI co-pilots for autonomous
wingmen drones
–
by 2025, prototypes of drones that fly alongside manned fighters,
making independent tactical decisions, have shown promise. In short, AI software is
permeating defense systems, albeit carefully. The Pentagon adheres to ethical AI
principles (established 2020) to ensure human judgement in lethal decisions, but the
trend is toward greater machine autonomy in routine and high-speed tasks.
China and Russia are racing too. China’s military has embraced the concept of
“intelligent-ized” warfare, investing heavily in AI for swarm drones, wargaming Taiwan
invasion scenarios, and propaganda generation. Russia, despite sanctions, uses AI in
propaganda bots and likely in some military targeting (though their high-tech
development has been set back by war losses and sanctions). The U.S. must keep
pushing the envelope
–
hence DARPA runs projects like ACE (Air Combat Evolution)
where AI already beat human pilots in simulated dogfights, hinting at a future where AI
handles split-second combat moves. AI hardware R&D also includes quantum computing
potential: while not exactly AI, a quantum leap could accelerate AI algorithms beyond
current supercomputers. The U.S. leads in quantum research but is in a neck-and-neck
race with China.
Military Adoption and Integration
Adopting AI across the vast U.S. defense enterprise is a work in progress. One challenge
is integration
–
making sure new AI systems can plug into legacy platforms and
workflows. The Department of Defense has learned from past tech waves that piloting is
easier than scaling. In 2025, there are several AI success stories at the unit level, but
broader adoption requires cultural change and trust. For instance, intelligence analysts
initially were skeptical of AI threat-identification tools, fearing a “black box.” Through
training and proven performance (AI flags oft-missed indicators, etc.), confidence is
growing. The goal is a “human-AI teaming” model: analysts focus on interpretation and
judgement, while AI handles data grunt work. Similarly, in command centers, junior
oﬃcers now have AI assistants that can pull up logistics statuses or predict enemy
movements based on patterns
–
essentially acting as an advanced decision aid.
Adoption rates vary by service and function. The Air Force and Navy, being tech-heavy,
have moved quickly on AI for maintenance, intelligence, and cyber defense. The Army,
dealing with massive human elements, has been cautious but is rolling out AI-driven
personnel management (talent matching soldiers to jobs) and experimenting with robotic
wingmen vehicles in combat units. The Space Force inherently relies on AI to monitor
thousands of objects in orbit and manage satellite constellations. Notably, U.S. nuclear
forces are compartmentalized from AI control
–
safety dictates that launch decisions
remain firmly human, with AI maybe assisting in threat detection only. Outside DoD, the
Intelligence Community (CIA, NSA, NGA) is a heavy AI adopter for analysis and collection
–
e.g., NSA filtering signals intercepts with AI language processing to catch key
conversations faster.
A big factor is training and education. The services have begun incorporating AI literacy
into professional military education. Future commanders need to know what AI can and
cannot do. West Point and other academies have added courses on data science and AI
ethics. The DoD is also recruiting tech talent through programs that bring in civilian AI
experts on short-term contracts or commission tech-specialty oﬃcers. However,
competition with private sector salaries is tough; initiatives like the “Cyber Excepted
Service” and direct commissioning are attempts to bridge that gap.
On the industry side, defense contractors are embedding AI in new weapons: a 2025
model fighter jet might come with an AI-enabled radar that learns and adapts to jamming
in real time. The Army’s next-gen combat vehicle prototypes include autonomous
navigation modes. But integrating these into the force means updating doctrines and
tactics. We’ve seen some fruits: in 2024 exercises, a Marine battalion used an AI battle
management system to coordinate drone swarms with artillery, responding to enemy
moves faster than traditional command post processes
–
it was a glimpse of AI-
accelerated OODA loops (Observe-Orient-Decide-Act). Still, widespread fielding could be
a decade oﬀ for most units.
Crucially, the Pentagon is working on reliability and testing for AI. Unlike a rifle, an AI’s
“failure mode” could be unusual or hard to predict. They conduct rigorous red-teaming of
AI (trying to trick it or see how it fails). There have been instances of AI misidentification
–
e.g., classifying a civilian vehicle as a tank due to mud or a decal
–
reminding us that
these systems are fallible. The integration strategy is thus phased: first use AI in non-
lethal, advisory roles; gradually expand as confidence and proof of safety build. The
defense acquisition system, historically slow, is being reformed (with rapid prototyping
and software-centric contracts) to avoid bottlenecking AI integration.
Regulation and Governance
The breakneck pace of AI advancement has policymakers grappling with how to govern
its development and use. On the international stage, calls for norms or even treaties on
certain AI applications (like fully autonomous weapons) are growing. The U.S. stance has
been to champion responsible AI use rather than outright bans at this stage. In 2025, the
Pentagon follows its Ethical AI principles
–
emphasizing that AI should be traceable,
reliable, and governable by humans. There is an internal directive that any lethal force
decision by an AI must have human authorization, in line with our values and to reduce
risk of unintended conflict.
Domestically, the U.S. government has been working on regulatory frameworks.
Congress held hearings in 2024 about AI safety, deepfakes, and economic disruption.
While broad legislation is still being debated, some steps have been taken: for example,
the FTC monitors AI in consumer products for fairness, and there are guidelines on AI in
hiring or finance to prevent bias. For national security AI, regulation is more internal
–
classification and oversight mechanisms to ensure AI tools don’t violate privacy or civil
liberties (e.g., using AI on surveillance footage within legal bounds). An AI Safety Board
within DoD reviews major programs.
Meanwhile, allies and partners are aligning. The EU’s AI Act (expected around 2025) will
impose strict rules on AI, and the U.S. is coordinating so that defense AI development
isn’t hamstrung by divergent rules. There’s also movement in NATO: it released an AI
strategy outlining principles and encouraging interoperability of AI systems among allies.
A significant governance issue is narrative control around AI
–
avoiding public panic or
unrealistic expectations. The term “killer robots” often surfaces; Pentagon oﬃcials have
been transparent that human accountability remains in force, trying to dispel dystopian
fears. However, the potential of adversaries deploying lethal autonomous weapons
(LAWs) has spurred U.S. to consider an international regime. Thus far, talks at the UN
CCW (Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons) have not yielded a ban on LAWs,
due to diﬀerences (with Russia and China opposed to binding limits). The U.S. position
has been to propose a non-binding code of conduct for military AI and continue research
so as not to be caught technologically flat-footed.
On commercial AI regulation, because private firms drive much AI innovation, the
government uses a mix of incentives and light-touch rules. There’s discussion of
requiring testing and certification for advanced AI models (somewhat like FDA process
for algorithms aﬀecting safety), but nothing firm yet. The Biden (and now second-term or
successive administration) approach was voluntary commitments from AI companies
–
e.g., pledges to allow external red-teaming and to watermark AI-generated content to
help detection of deepfakes. By May 2025, some of those practices are being adopted,
but enforcement is nascent.
One key area of concern is data governance. AI needs massive data, and protecting
sensitive data (from personal info to defense databases) is crucial. Regulations on data
sharing with foreign entities have been tightened
–
e.g., restricting Chinese access to
American genetic or social media data that could train AI. Also, DoD has created secure
data repositories to fuel its AI without risking leaks (classified data lakes with controlled
access).
In summary, governance is trying to balance innovation and security/ethics. The U.S.
aims not to stifle the tech that could ensure military advantage or economic growth, but
it is moving to shape AI development in line with democratic norms. This is an evolving
space
–
akin to early nuclear arms control days, except moving at digital speed. The next
few years will likely see more concrete policy as AI incidents (good or bad) inform
lawmakers. For now, the U.S. chooses to lead by example, implementing internal ethical
guardrails and pushing that model internationally to set standards before others (or a
disaster) set them for us.
AI in Narrative Warfare
AI’s impact on the information domain
–
what we might call narrative warfare
–
has been
profound. The ability of AI to generate text, audio, and video that are nearly
indistinguishable from human-created content has opened new fronts in propaganda and
psychological operations. Adversaries are actively exploring AI to enhance their
influence campaigns. Deepfakes are a prime example: highly realistic fake videos or
audio recordings can now be produced with relatively modest eﬀort. In the wrong hands,
this technology can be weaponized to create false narratives or sow confusion. For
instance, one fear (thankfully not realized yet) is a deepfake of a U.S. President or military
commander issuing a fake emergency alert or surrender message
–
which could cause
chaos before being debunked. Already, Russian operatives have used simpler forms of
synthetic media, like face-swapped photos, to impersonate Ukrainian oﬃcials in phishing
schemes.
AI-driven bots have also multiplied. Earlier generations of bots were easy to spot (clunky
language, repetitive posts), but modern AI like large language models can produce fluid,
context-aware dialogue. This means on social media and comment sections, it’s harder
than ever to tell a human from an AI. During geopolitical crises, one can expect swarms
of AI-powered accounts amplifying certain hashtags, drowning out opposing viewpoints,
and possibly even engaging individuals in one-on-one “persuasion” conversations. Both
Russia and China have invested in such capabilities. China’s model is more platform-
centric censorship and flooding (internally, using AI to censor dissent; externally,
providing pro-China content), whereas Russia’s approach is narrative-centric
–
flooding
the zone with a thousand conspiracy theories to confuse audiences . AI supercharges
both: it can generate countless variants of a lie, tailored to diﬀerent audiences, at a
speed and scale impossible for human trolls .
On the flip side, AI also aids counter-narrative eﬀorts. U.S. tech companies and agencies
employ AI to detect coordinated inauthentic behavior online. Machine learning systems
track patterns (like bursts of new accounts or linguistic fingerprints) to flag bot
networks. They also help identify deepfakes
–
although that’s a cat-and-mouse game as
deepfakes improve. The Department of Homeland Security has funded research into
deepfake detection, given concerns for election security . DARPA’s Semantic Forensics
(SemaFor) program is pushing technology to automatically verify media integrity , which
will be key as we head into an era where “seeing is not believing.”
Narrative warfare now extends beyond social media to chatbots and voice assistants.
There is concern adversaries might infiltrate widely used AI assistants with subtle
misinformation. For example, if an AI assistant is trained on contaminated data, it might
occasionally spout adversary-favored talking points. Companies are aware of this risk
and working on alignment to ensure AI doesn’t go rogue or biased. However, open-
source models are out there, which extremist groups or terrorists could fine-tune to
produce propaganda or even guides for radicalization and attack methods.
A real-time case in narrative warfare is the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. Russia
flooded global channels with claims (bioweapons labs, Nazi leadership in Kyiv, etc.), but
Ukraine and the West repeatedly countered with facts and also used intelligence releases
to preempt lies . AI plays a role in analyzing these huge volumes of content to measure
what narratives are trending and where intervention is needed. The U.S. Global
Engagement Center and NATO StratCom units likely use AI sentiment analysis to gauge
foreign publics’ reactions and decide where to push counter-messaging.
Eﬀectiveness of counter-narratives in the AI era is mixed so far. On one hand, Western
governments have gotten faster at debunking falsehoods (sometimes within hours) and
AI tools assist by instantly translating and analyzing enemy propaganda. On the other
hand, the sheer volume of AI-generated misinformation can overwhelm fact-checkers.
Also, a phenomenon known as the “liar’s dividend” arises: public awareness that
deepfakes exist can make people start doubting even real, authentic evidence . For
example, a real video of an atrocity might be dismissed by skeptics as “probably a
deepfake.” This corrosive eﬀect on truth is a major irony and challenge of the AI narrative
battlespace.
The national security community is adjusting doctrine accordingly. “Cognitive security” is
now discussed as part of comprehensive defense. Training troops and even citizens to
recognize and resist influence (digital literacy) is being treated as important
–
essentially
inoculating the populace against manipulation. We are in an era where narrative
supremacy can have tangible battlefield eﬀects: imagine soldiers receiving an apparently
authentic order via radio, generated by enemy AI mimicry
–
could sow chaos in ranks.
Thus, authentication tools (code words, blockchain verification of orders) are being
explored to complement counter-narratives.
In sum, AI has turbocharged narrative warfare, making it faster and more immersive. The
U.S. must continue to innovate in both leveraging AI for truthful strategic communication
and defending against its malicious use. Our adversaries certainly are doing so. It’s an
intellectual arms race: AI can automate persuasion, but it can also automate truth
verification. The side that better adapts its society and systems to the new information
environment will have a strategic edge. Right now, democracies are playing catch-up to
the flood of AI propaganda, but awareness is high. We are employing AI to detect and
counter lies in real time, engaging tech firms to label synthetic media, and sharing
intelligence publicly to beat false narratives to the punch . The battle for truth has never
been more complex
–
it’s essentially the war of the story, fought byte by byte, across
global consciousness. And AI is both a sword and shield in that fight.
Countering AI-Driven Threats and Future Outlook
As AI becomes embedded in all facets of security
–
from the frontline to the information
space
–
the U.S. is developing robust countermeasures to mitigate AI-driven threats. One
area is adversarial AI, where one uses input tricks to confuse an opponent’s AI. U.S. labs
are working on ways to spoof or jam enemy autonomous systems
–
for example, using
special patterns to blind an AI vision system or hacking into the control loops of a drone
swarm. Electronic warfare may evolve to target AI algorithms specifically (imagine
sending a malicious data packet that makes an enemy’s targeting AI mis-classify
everything). Conversely, we’re hardening our own AI against such tricks by training on
adversarial examples and isolating critical systems.
Another focus is fail-safe mechanisms. For any AI integrated into weapons, there are
manual overrides and fallback modes. If an AI malfunctions or is suspected of
compromise, operators are trained to revert to traditional control. This dual-mode
approach will likely persist until AI reliability is ironclad (which it may never be, as no
system is perfect).
Looking ahead, the eﬀectiveness of AI will push nations into a new kind of competition
–
not just an arms race in AI tech, but in AI counter-tech. This includes treaties or norms as
mentioned, but also unilateral eﬀorts like perhaps geofencing autonomous weapons
(e.g., ensuring our armed robots cannot operate outside certain zones or without a
specific encrypted signal present). There’s recognition that some Pandora’s boxes are
opening
–
lethal autonomous drones that can hunt without direct human input have
already been used on a small scale (Turkey’s Kargu drones reportedly had autonomous
attack mode in Libya). To prevent a destabilizing proliferation, the U.S. has been
convening allies to agree on basic limits and share information on rogue actor use of AI
in war.
We also plan for AI’s eﬀect on command decision-making. As AI provides rapid options,
there’s a human temptation to trust the machine. Military education is stressing that AI is
a tool, not a crutch; commanders must apply judgment and consider AI outputs critically.
War games are being run where one side’s overreliance on AI is exploited by a cunning
adversary
–
teaching balance.
In the national security narrative, AI is often touted as the next oﬀset technology that will
ensure U.S. superiority if harnessed correctly. But an irony looms: if not handled carefully,
AI could also undermine security
–
through accidental conflict escalation (an AI
misinterprets a drill as an attack), or loss of human control. This duality is why the 2020s
are a pivotal time for setting the tone. The U.S. intends to stay ahead in AI militarily, while
leading in shaping its use responsibly. The world has seen turning points with new tech
before (like nuclear weapons in 1945)
–
AI is less immediately destructive but potentially
just as revolutionary.
The eﬀectiveness of counter-narratives in particular will hinge on public-private synergy.
Tech firms deploying social media or messaging platforms must be onboard to police AI
fakes and botnets. Already, platforms like Twitter (now X) and Facebook improved at
removing Russia’s IRA troll farms since 2016, but the game changed with generative AI
–
requiring new detection algorithms and perhaps digital signatures in content.
Governments may need to require labeling of AI-generated media or fund public
awareness campaigns so citizens think twice (“verify before amplify” ethos).
Encouragingly, some disinformation has been eﬀectively countered: for instance, when
Lavrov spread a bioweapon lab lie, it was debunked and did not gain mainstream traction
. We need more of that agility.
Looking toward 2030, AI will be even more entrenched: autonomous vehicles, smart city
infrastructure, AI assistants. National security planners consider how those could be
turned into weapons (hijacked cars as kinetic weapons, AI managing power grids
targeted to cause blackouts). Hence, interagency cooperation (DoD, DHS, DoE, etc.) on
AI threat response is ramping up
–
ensuring if an AI-related attack on critical
infrastructure occurs, there’s a coordinated defense and attribution plan.
In conclusion, AI oﬀers a leap in capability but comes with equivalent challenges. It
amplifies both strength and potential chaos. The U.S. strategy is to maximize our AI
strengths
–
better, faster decision-making; improved autonomous defense; dominance in
the info space
–
while minimizing vulnerabilities through robust safeguards and ethical
leadership. Our adversaries will exploit AI ruthlessly; we must counter them with AI and
human ingenuity combined. The narrative going forward may very well be that those who
integrate AI most eﬀectively (technically and morally) will shape the balance of power.
America intends to be on the winning side of that story, ensuring our AI advances serve
to protect peace and freedom, rather than subvert them.
Historical Parallels and Strategic Turning Points
Germany 1943
–
Overreach and Turning Tides
Historical Analog: In 1943, Nazi Germany hit a catastrophic turning point in World War II.
After years of swift expansion, Germany’s overreach led to calamitous defeats
–
most
notably the surrender at Stalingrad in February 1943, where the German Sixth Army was
encircled and destroyed. That defeat “became the turning point of World War II”, marking
the first major German loss on the Eastern Front and shattering the myth of Nazi
invincibility . Later in July 1943, Germany’s last grand oﬀensive at Kursk failed, and from
then on, the Wehrmacht was on the defensive, steadily pushed back by the Allies.
Importantly, Germany’s industrial base was strained, facing Allied strategic bombing and
resource shortfalls, while its enemies grew stronger with U.S. production in full gear and
the Soviet Union rallying. The year 1943 showed how a regime that had seemed
unstoppable could be ground down by resilient adversaries and its own strategic folly.
Hitler refused to consider negotiated peace, doubling down even as fortunes waned
–
sealing Germany’s fate to fight to utter ruin.
Echoes in 2025: The situation of Russia in Ukraine draws some parallels to Germany in
1943. Putin’s Russia, after initial successes in 2014 (Crimea) and early 2022 thrusts, has
seen its campaign stall and reverse amid fierce Ukrainian and international resistance.
Much like Germany’s ill-fated drive into the Soviet Union, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine
was predicated on a quick victory that never materialized. Now Russia finds itself in a
grinding war of attrition that is depleting its military and economic strength. Western
intelligence estimates indicate Russia has lost staggering amounts of equipment
–
at
least 7,400 armored vehicles and 2,300 tanks to date
–
losses reminiscent of entire
panzer armies obliterated on the Eastern Front. Its casualties too, largely from mobilized
reservists, erode the qualitative edge once feared. We may be witnessing a 1943-like
inflection point: Ukraine’s successful defense of Kyiv and counteroﬀensives (akin to the
Soviet defense of Moscow and counter at Stalingrad) have shifted initiative. If Ukraine’s
partners maintain support, Russia might, like Germany post-1943, face progressively
worsening outcomes.
However, historical analogies are not identity. Unlike Hitler in 1943, Putin still hopes to
outlast rather than outright win
–
banking on Western unity cracking. Yet one senses the
overreach: Russia’s attempt to redraw borders by force has galvanized an opposing
coalition (NATO unity, global sanctions) similar to how Germany’s aggression united the
Allies. There is also an irony: Russia invokes the Great Patriotic War memory, casting
Ukraine as “Nazi,” but in truth Russia now finds itself in the position of the overextended
invader on Ukrainian soil
–
a historical role reversal. If 2024–2025 bring further Russian
setbacks, historians may look back on 2023 as “Russia’s Stalingrad,” the point at which
the war’s tide turned irreversibly. The lesson from Germany 1943 is that once strategic
momentum shifts decisively, it is nearly impossible for a beleaguered great power to
recover, especially under inflexible authoritarian leadership. That cautionary tale might
apply to Putin’s regime, potentially facing calamity if it cannot adjust course.
The KKK Acts (1871)
–
Security vs Civil Liberties
Historical Analog: In the aftermath of the U.S. Civil War, the federal government
confronted a domestic insurgency by the Ku Klux Klan, which terrorized Black citizens
and oﬃcials to undermine Reconstruction. To protect civil rights and restore order,
President Ulysses S. Grant pushed for extraordinary legal measures. The Third
Enforcement Act of April 1871
–
commonly known as the Ku Klux Klan Act
–
empowered
the President to use military force against the Klan and “to suspend habeas corpus, if
necessary, to enforce the act.” Grant indeed declared martial law in parts of South
Carolina, suspending habeas corpus in October 1871 to facilitate mass arrests of Klan
members . These actions, though aggressive, succeeded in largely breaking the back of
the first Klan and upholding the law where local authorities had failed. However, this
came at the cost of curtailing civil liberties temporarily; it stands as one of the few times
in U.S. history (aside from the Civil War) that habeas corpus was suspended. The irony
was that such a drastic suspension of a fundamental right was employed to safeguard
the constitutional rights of freed slaves against terrorist violence. It highlights the
perennial tension between security and liberty: the government will go to great lengths
–
even suspending core legal protections
–
when faced with internal rebellion and terror.
Echoes in 2025: While today’s challenges are diﬀerent, the dilemma of balancing civil
liberties with security in the face of internal threats is very much alive. The U.S. in recent
years has grappled with surges in domestic violent extremism
–
for example, the January
6, 2021 Capitol attack was a stark reminder of insurrectionist potential. Federal response
to that has been robust but within normal legal process (hundreds of arrests,
prosecutions under existing statutes). We have not seen modern use of martial law or
suspension of habeas corpus; such steps are regarded as last resorts. Yet, the KKK Act
precedent lingers in legal memory. Notably, that 1871 law is still partially on the books
and has been cited in civil suits against contemporary extremist groups for conspiring to
deprive others of rights. The federal government has so far managed to contain threats
via conventional law enforcement
–
e.g., prosecuting militia plots, using the PATRIOT Act
for lone wolves, infiltrating plots via the FBI. But one can imagine scenarios (a wave of
coordinated bombings, or large-scale armed standoﬀs) where authorities might consider
more drastic measures. Discussions in the Homeland Security realm sometimes
reference how Grant “snuﬀed out” the Klan by temporarily overriding certain rights
–
a
move not lightly made, but arguably eﬀective.
The lesson of 1871 is two-fold: First, domestic terrorism can reach a level where it truly
undermines the constitutional order, warranting exceptional federal intervention. Second,
once order is restored, those extraordinary powers must be relinquished to return to
normalcy, lest they themselves corrupt the constitutional order. In our current context,
we strive to avoid reaching that crisis point. Improved coordination against domestic
terror cells, de-radicalization programs, and community policing are modern strategies
aiming to preempt the need for extreme legal measures. Nonetheless, the enforcement
acts of the Reconstruction era stand as a reminder that the U.S. has faced homegrown
insurgency before and responded forcefully
–
suspending habeas corpus to save the
Constitution from insurrectionists . It’s a historical irony that sometimes protecting liberty
requires a temporary and tightly scoped infringement of liberty. The challenge in 2025 is
navigating threats like violent white supremacists or accelerationist groups in a way that
upholds the rule of law without giving them the chaos they seek. If, heaven forbid, a
domestic insurgency ever grew as bold and violent as the post-Civil War Klan, leaders
might have to channel Grant’s resolve
–
hopefully with the same clarity of purpose and
temporary scope seen in 1871.
The Bonus Army (1932)
–
Veterans and Social Stability
Historical Analog: In 1932, during the depths of the Great Depression, about 20,000 World
War I veterans, many destitute and jobless, marched on Washington, D.C. to demand
early payment of a bonus promised to them (due in 1945). These “Bonus Army” veterans
camped in the capital for weeks. After Congress rejected their petition and most refused
to leave, the government’s response turned violent. President Hoover ordered U.S. Army
troops under Gen. Douglas MacArthur to evict the veterans. MacArthur’s men cleared the
camps with bayonets, tear gas, and set the veterans’ makeshift shanties on fire, causing
injuries and at least two deaths . This harsh crackdown shocked the nation; the sight of
American soldiers using force on former servicemen was a public relations disaster for
Hoover and a tragedy for those who had served their country. The Bonus March incident
underscored how badly neglected veterans’ welfare can lead to social unrest and how
using the military to resolve such situations can backfire terribly. It did, however, prompt
changes: by 1936, Congress agreed to pay out the bonuses early (overriding President
Roosevelt’s veto), and it influenced the creation of the G.I. Bill a decade later to better
support WWII vets and avoid repeating that scenario.
Echoes in 2025: The Bonus Army serves as a cautionary tale for today. We recognize that
veterans, especially combat veterans, carry not just physical scars but moral
expectations of fair treatment. If those expectations are betrayed (through insuﬃcient
benefits, lack of jobs, or feeling forgotten), it can become a powder keg in hard
economic times. While the U.S. economy in 2025 is not in a 1930s-level depression, there
have been stresses (e.g., pandemic aftermath, inflationary pressures). Up to now, we
have largely avoided severe veteran discontent in a collective sense
–
veterans’ advocacy
groups are very active and Congress has been responsive with legislation like the PACT
Act for toxic exposures and continual adjustments to VA funding. Unemployment among
post-9/11 veterans, once a concern, has improved due to hiring initiatives. However,
some segments (like older vets from Vietnam era or those with serious injuries) still
struggle with homelessness or underemployment.
The key parallel is understanding veterans as a societal bellwether. They exemplify the
promises and pitfalls of the social contract. For instance, if tens of thousands of recent
war vets felt abandoned, we could see mass protests or rise in extremist group
membership (some militia and patriot groups explicitly recruit veterans by stoking
feelings of betrayal). Indeed, some analysis of the January 6 Capitol rioters noted a
disproportionate number of veterans involved, suggesting a subset who felt their oath
was calling them to action misguidedly. It’s not the Bonus Army camping on the Mall, but
it rhymes: veterans seeking purpose and justice can be manipulated if society doesn’t
integrate them well.
Preventive Measures: Learning from 1932, the U.S. has invested in veteran reintegration.
The GI Bill after WWII was directly to avoid another Bonus March scenario, by providing
education and home loans. Today’s Post-9/11 GI Bill is robust and widely used. VA
healthcare, while overburdened, has expanded to include mental health care and
community care options. There’s an emphasis on treating issues like PTSD and TBI early,
to ease veterans back into civilian life. Additionally, unlike 1932, where the response was
force first, modern authorities engage more with veterans groups to handle grievances.
One could imagine if a large veteran protest happened now, government approach would
be negotiation and accommodation rather than bayonets
–
precisely to avoid repeating
Hoover’s error.
Another irony is that in 1932, those veterans were met with military force by their own
former commanders (MacArthur and then-Major George Patton were WWI vets
themselves). In our current ethos, using active military against veterans or any protesters
is seen as a last resort; we rely on law enforcement and de-escalation. Posse Comitatus
Act and lessons from Kent State etc. also urge caution in domestic military use. So, the
Bonus Army stands as a stark reminder: honor your veterans and uphold justice, or risk
domestic strife that pits the nation against its heroes. We strive to ensure that no veteran
today has cause to lose faith in the country they served
–
because if they do, the moral
injury and societal impact can be grave.
Echoes in 2025

Turning Points and Ironies
Drawing these historical strands together, we see a tapestry of turning points and ironies
that resonate today:
• Turning Points: Just as 1943 signaled a decisive turn in WWII, we
may be living through inflection points in our current conflicts and rivalries. The
Ukraine war could be at such a juncture
–
the moment when aggression is
irreversibly halted and rolled back by the concerted eﬀorts of free nations. In the
Indo-Pacific, we might be near a turning point in the balance of power; how we
deter or confront China’s provocations in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait in
the next few years will chart the course for decades. These moments are
analogous to pivotal battles or decisions in history that changed trajectories
(Stalingrad 1943, or the Cuban Missile Crisis 1962 for another). Recognizing when
one is at a turning point is crucial; failing to do so might mean missing
opportunities or misallocating resources. In 2025, U.S. strategic planners are
keenly aware that our actions now
–
in arming Ukraine, in investing in new tech
like AI, in shoring up alliances
–
could be looked back upon as the hinge that
swung the 21st century’s fate one way or the other.
• Overreach and Hubris: History often shows great powers defeated
by their own overreach (Germany invading the USSR, the U.S. in Vietnam, perhaps
the Soviet Union in Afghanistan). A current irony is that adversaries who decry
Western “hegemonism” may be falling into the same trap: Russia bit oﬀ more than
it could chew in Ukraine; China’s aggressive expansion has awakened regional
coalitions against it. The United States must heed these lessons too
–
we learned
painfully in Iraq the cost of underestimating post-war challenges. Now, in an era of
renewed rivalry, we must calibrate ambition and avoid hubris. We preach a
“strength with humility” approach: build power and coalitions, but listen to local
partners and respect limits of force. The paradox is that restraint and patience
often yield more enduring results than unbridled use of might.
• Security vs. Liberty Irony: The KKK Acts episode underscores a
fundamental irony of democracies: to preserve the rule of law, leaders may
temporarily break it (suspending habeas corpus). In our age, tools like the
PATRIOT Act, FISA surveillance, and emergency health measures during COVID all
raised similar issues. We strive to remain a nation of laws even when facing
lawless enemies. The irony is that free societies must sometimes act illiberally
(surveillance, infiltration, kinetic action) to protect liberalism. But if done
transparently and with oversight, the republic weathers it. Grant’s usage of
extreme measures was validated by outcome and limited scope. Today we
emphasize sunset clauses and oversight on any extraordinary powers. The state
of AI and surveillance could tempt some to push for expansive monitoring
–
we
must balance that as we did historically, remembering how easy it is to lose what
we’re protecting if we over-correct.
• Veterans and Society: The Bonus Army taught America about caring
for those who served, and indeed the GI Bill after WWII was one of history’s great
positive turning points (preventing unrest, creating a prosperous middle class).
Now, after 20 years of war, we have another wave of veterans rejoining society.
Will this be a turning point toward a “Next Greatest Generation” of civic leaders
and innovators (many vets are running for oﬃce, starting businesses), or, if
mishandled, could it turn into social unrest or fragmentation? The irony is
veterans are simultaneously celebrated and sometimes overlooked. We have NFL
salutes and public thank-yous, yet some veterans struggle quietly with injury or
finding purpose. Ensuring their successful integration is both a moral duty and
strategically smart (they become assets, not sources of instability). A modern
“bonus” could be in education, employment, and mental health
–
arguably more
valuable than a check.
• Technology and Change: We are in a technological turning point with
AI akin to the nuclear revolution or the advent of the internet. The irony here is the
democratization of power
–
small actors can wield AI or cyber might once
reserved for superpowers. A lone hacker group can rob a country or influence an
election. This echoes the invention of gunpowder or printing press
–
technologies
that upended old hierarchies. The strategic community must adapt to an era
where strength is not just tanks and bombs, but algorithms and data. That is a
profound shift, perhaps as significant as mechanization was in WWII. Those who
adapt (like the U.S. embracing jointness and precision warfare in the late 20th
century) will prevail, those who cling to old paradigms may falter.
• Alliances and Unity: NATO today flips the script that many expected
–
rather than fracturing under strain, it enlarged and strengthened in response to
war. There’s an irony that Putin’s attempt to weaken NATO led to its expansion
(Finland/Sweden). Similarly, the Five Eyes
–
an Anglosphere alliance China or
Russia thought they could divide via espionage or diplomacy
–
is tighter than ever,
even sharing guidance to protect capitalist innovations . It’s reminiscent of how
Axis powers thought the Allies (with diﬀerent ideologies: capitalist America,
communist USSR) would never truly unify
–
and were proven wrong as the Allies
coordinated grand strategy to win WWII.
• Moral and Narrative Clarity: In WWII, especially after 1943, the moral
clarity of stopping fascism galvanized the U.S. and Allies despite sacrifices. In the
current era, maintaining a clear narrative of why we stand firm is key. We position
it as democracy vs. authoritarian aggression, rule-of-law vs. might-makes-right
–
themes that resonate with our populace and many worldwide. The irony is our
adversaries often accuse us of the very imperialism or chaos they themselves
practice (e.g., China calling U.S. an agent of instability in Asia, when it is Beijing
building bases and bullying neighbors). By exposing these contradictions, we
strengthen our cause. We’ve seen how dangerous false narratives (like Nazi
propaganda or Soviet disinformation) can be; now AI threatens to amplify those.
Yet truth still has power: when the Nazi horrors were fully revealed, the world’s
revulsion created a consensus for a new order (UN, human rights, etc.). Perhaps
current adversaries’ misdeeds, once laid bare (like atrocities in Bucha, or Xinjiang
camps), will similarly rally global resolve for justice.
In wrapping up this strategic brief, one overarching lesson emerges: those who
fail to learn from history’s turning points are doomed to repeat its tragedies. We
channel the insight of historical examples
–
using them as guideposts, not direct
templates. General Mattis often emphasizes reading history to illuminate present
challenges. The spirit of “Call Sign CHAOS”
–
Colonel Has Another Outstanding
Solution
–
is to combine historical wisdom with creative strategy. Thus, we heed
1943’s sign that aggressors can and must be rolled back, 1871’s resolve to protect
the Republic from internal subversion, 1932’s empathy to care for our own, and
countless other lessons. The irony that runs through them is that in striving to do
right, free nations may stumble or even momentarily contradict themselves, but if
they correct course, they emerge stronger.
Strategic Foresight: As of May 10, 2025, the world stands at multiple crossroads. The
assessments and analogies above suggest cautious optimism that the United States and
its allies can navigate the chaos. By understanding the terrain (literal and figurative),
fortifying the populace’s will, controlling the information space, protecting our
infrastructure, and never forgetting the human dimension (from active duty troops to
veterans to citizens), we position ourselves to turn potential crises into manageable
challenges. History’s turning points and ironies teach us humility and determination
–
we
will need both in abundance. In the end, if we remain true to our values while being
adaptable in strategy, we can, like the generation of 1943 or the Reconstruction
Republicans of 1871, steer events toward a favorable outcome, ensuring that freedom,
once again, prevails against the odds.
