Each tier adds more recursive depth, allowing additional internal dialogue cycles or agent overlays to handle the complexity.",
           "Certain trigger conditions (like an OODA-loop disruption or narrative conflict overload) cause an immediate jump to a higher tier, engaging a broader set of agent resources. For example, if a decision loop stalls or an ethical ambiguity arises, the system invokes deeper recursion to muster more problem-solving capacity – analogous to a Contextual Stack Resolver assigning an optimal multi-agent overlay in response [oai_citation:6‡file-tbaftkjgtuynlxwqw2m5kf](file://file-TbaftKJgtUYNLxwqW2m5KF#:~:text=trigger_conditions%3A%20,need%2C%20memory%20load%2C%20and%20trust).",

Agents use a shared secret derived from the passphrase to sign and verify messages internally, ensuring any rogue component without the secret is rejected.

This means an agent at layer N will only accept input from layer N-1 if a valid passphrase-linked token is attached, preventing stray or malicious recursion threads. Thus, the motto literally and metaphorically links the layers together."

For instance, the Manager Protector has a 'Sentinel mode' that activates under perceived social engineering, and the Firefighter has a 'Containment mode' for infohazards. Layers share minimal necessary information with each other (principle of least privilege) and authenticate via the passphrase handshake, making it difficult for an outside threat to move laterally through the system. The combination of IFS-informed design (which inherently monitors distress signals) with robust counterintelligence heuristics means the architecture can detect both emotional sabotage (trauma triggers exploited by an attacker) and technical exploits in real time, and respond appropriately."

       "bootstrap_handshake": "Codex18 and beyond will initiate with the same passphrase handshake (or an upgraded version of it), ensuring continuity. Legacy support means Codex17 can verify a successor system by exchanging the motto or an agreed transformation of it, establishing lineage trust. This prevents a scenario where a malicious actor tries to introduce a fake 'Codex18'—without the motto handshake, it would be rejected.",
       "scalability": "The recursive agent stack can scale with hardware improvements or distributed computing. For open-source release, configuration flags (like maximum RI tier, recursion limits, active modules) are tunable so communities can adapt it to their needs or capacities. The design anticipates quantum-safe cryptographic upgrades (the passphrase handshake can shift to post-quantum algorithms) to keep the system secure as technology evolves.",
